# Central-Healthcare-Information-Accessibility-and-Authorization-Management-Using-Blockchain

This project is a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used to develop decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract, named "PatientHistory", is designed to store and manage medical records of patients in a decentralized and secure manner.

The contract allows authorized medical centers to add test reports of patients, update or remove existing reports, and retrieve the medical history of a patient. Patients are identified using unique IDs and their records are associated with these IDs. The contract also includes functions to add and remove patients from the system.

Overall, this contract can be used to create a secure and decentralized system for managing medical records of patients, providing them control over their data and enabling authorized medical centers to access and update the records when necessary.
